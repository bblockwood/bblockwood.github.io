      <p class="paper-entry" data-abstract="We use natural experiments embedded in state-run lotteries and a new nationally representative survey to provide reduced-form and structural estimates of risk preferences and behavioral biases in lottery demand, and to explore the implications for optimal lottery design. We find that sales respond more to the expected value of the jackpot than to price and are unresponsive to variation in the second prize, a pattern consistent with probability weighting. Survey evidence suggests Americans would spend substantially less on lotteries if unbiased, and calibrated welfare analysis implies current multi-state lottery designs increase welfare overall but may harm heavy spenders."><b><a href="papers/Lockwood_Allcott_Taubinsky_Sial_2024_RES_Lotteries.pdf">What Drives Demand for State-Run Lotteries?

Calibrating uncertainty about taxable-income elasticity using past empirical work and survey evidence on economists' beliefs, we compare robust tax rates to policies based on point estimates. The robust optimum is typically more progressive, raising top marginal rates by roughly 5 to 7 percentage points and generating modest expected welfare gains."><b><a href="papers/Lockwood_Sial_Weinzierl_2021.pdf">Designing, Not Checking, for Policy Robustness: An Example with Optimal Taxation</a></b><br>

This paper studies implications for optimal income taxation when present-biased workers choose multiple dimensions of labor effort, some occurring before compensation. Present bias lowers optimal tax rates, with larger effects when taxable-income elasticity is high, and can imply negative optimal marginal rates at low incomes as a corrective rationale for work subsidies such as the Earned Income Tax Credit."><b><a href="papers/Lockwood_2020_IncomeTaxationWithPresentBias.pdf">Optimal Income Taxation with Present Bias</a></b><br>

      <p class="paper-entry" data-abstract="Taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), such as soda and bottled iced tea, are an increasingly popular approach to reducing obesity, diabetes, and other health harms. A basic economic principle is that such corrective taxes should be proportional to the harm caused. The harm from sugary drinks comes from the sugar, and SSBs vary substantially in sugar per unit volume. Yet SSB taxes typically set constant rates per unit volume. We estimate that a simple design change-taxing the amount of sugar in a drink, not the volume of liquid that accompanies the sugar-could boost a SSB tax's health benefits and overall economic gains by roughly 30%."><b><a href="papers/Grummon_Lockwood_Taubinsky_Allcott_2019_DesigningBetterSugaryDrinkTaxes.pdf">Designing Better Sugary Drink Taxes</a></b><br>
